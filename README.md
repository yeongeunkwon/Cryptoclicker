# Cryptoclicker

## Introduction 
Cryptoclicker was a team project with nine members. It is a platform to practice trading cryptocurrencies in volatile markets for people with little knowledge of cryptocurrency. Some features unique from traditional stock market applications are an ability to earn currency through mining, interactive learning session of cryptocurrencies, and a fictional market similar to real-life where users can practice trading without risking bitcoins.
